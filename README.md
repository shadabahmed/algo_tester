# Test Script

## How to run

* Replace code in file algo for your algorithm. You should use first command line argument as input and only output the result and nothing else

* trivial.rb contains a trivial but correct implementation of the algorithm

* File data contains 1000 sample inputs

* Once you are done, just run rspec

* For html output, just run - ```rspec --format html -o results.html```
